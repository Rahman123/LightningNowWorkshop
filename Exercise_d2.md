### **2A.  Introduction to Standard Sales App**

Lightning Experience comes automatically configured with standard Apps in addition to your custom Apps that have already been created in Salesforce Classic.  As we prepare for our pilot in our Trailhead Playground, lets take a look at what the standard Sales app and Sales Console app looks like in Lightning Experience and explore some of the end user features immediately available in Lightning Experience. These are features that your end users can take advantage of right away with basic user training.

1. Let's explore the Global Toolbar, Home Screen, and App Launcher in the Sales App
    
    1. Lets start in the upper right hand corner.  Click on the **down arrow** next to the ⭐️.  This is where items that you favorite are located.  We will add some favorites in a few minutes.
    
    2. Click the ➕.  These are your global actions to make it easy for you to log calls, create cases, and more.
   
   3. Click the ？.  This is the Help & Training section and where you can access help documentation, suggested Trailhead content, and view additional resources.
   
   4. Click the ⚙️ .  This is where you can access Setup, the Developer Console, and depending on where you are at, you might also be able to edit the page or the object.
   
   5. Click the **Bell icon**.  This is where you will see notifications sent to you.
   
   6. Click the **Profile Image** in the upper right.  As you saw previously, this is where you can switch to Classic, but you can also access your personal settings.
   
   7. In the Navigation Bar, click **Home**.  The home screen is made up of Components that you can customize.  You will see how this done later on today.
    8. Click the **App Launcher** **#**.  This allows you to change the App you are using as well as access individual items.
        1. Click **Service**.  Notice how the navigation bar objects change.
        2. Click the **App Launcher icon** and select **Sales**.
2. Now let's take a look at the Opportunity Workspace:
    1. In the Navigation bar, click on **Opportunities**.
        1. Click the down arrow next to Recently Viewed and click **All Opportunities.**
        2. Click **GenePoint Lab Generators.**
            1. Review the different sections of the Page:
                1. At the top you have the **Highlights Panel**.  Click the down arrow next to the New Case/New Note action.  You have several additional actions than you can select from here.
                2. On the left you have **Details, Activity,** and **Chatter**, from which you can schedule a task, an event, send an email, log a call, and chat about this account.  You can also view previous activity related to this account.
                3. Click **Details**.  You see all of the details of the Opportunity record..
                4. On the right you have the **Related** lists down the page.
            2. Hover your mouse over **GenePoint**.  See how basic account information appears at the top and the opportunities and case related lists appear. 
            3. Hover your mouse over each of the stages in the **Sales Path**.  This makes it very easy to track what stage in your Sales Process this opportunity is in.  
    2. Now, let's look at an Account:
        1. From the GenePoint Lab Generators record, click on **GenePoint**.
            1. Notice the different layout.
                1. Click **Details**.  You see all of the details of the account here, not just the basic information when you were looking at it from the Opportunity record.
                2. Click **News**.  As we enabled News earlier, you will now see this tab appear where you can view news related to this account.
                3. On the right you have **Activity** and **Chatter**, from which you can schedule a task, an event, send an email, log a call, and chat about this account.  You can also view previous activity related to this account.

        4. Click the down arrow next to the ⭐️ icon to view your renamed favorite item.

### 2B. Introduction to the Sales Console App

There are times where you are performing multiple actions at the same time. From working leads, logging calls, updating opportunities, adding contacts, and changing statuses, this means that you are back and forth between multiple records. The Sales Console App makes this task much simpler, as you can open multiple records at the same time, jump quickly from object to object, and log activity very simply. Here you learn what you can do with the Sales Console App, plus more importantly how can you configure it to meet your business needs. Let's jump in and see how this time saver works!
