title: Make your users more Productive with Productivity Features (On Your Own)  
---

We are on the way to a fully customized Sales Console App for our pilot and what's better is to discover some of the features that make Lightning Experience more productive for your users.  Users will be able to analyze data in their views without creating a report and be able to answer real-time analytical questions.  We will also see how we can make their data work for them.  So, let's get started.
